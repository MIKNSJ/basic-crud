## Setup
- Clone/copy the repository to your working environment.
- Visit/read the FastAPI documentation to install/setup a virtual environment and FastAPI.
- Activate the virtual environment before installing packages.

- If you are using uvicorn, then execute the command ```uvicorn main:app --reload``` to run the website. Otherwise, execute the
  command ```fastapi dev main.py``` for the default live server.
- In the command prompt or your terminal will provide a local host website where you can access the full functionality
  of the website there.
- Execute the command ```deactivate``` to close out of the virtual environment when finished.
